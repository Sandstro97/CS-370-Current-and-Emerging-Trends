# CS 370 Current & Emerging Trends

I wrote the code to encompasses the reinforcement learning algorithm by utilizing Keras and Tensorflow to achieve the pathfinding solution, through loops. 

Computer scientists are the problem solvers to complex problems with technology in innovative ways. I try to approach problems with a technical mindset by using the resources that are at my disposal and current technology knowledge to solve problems efficiently.

One of the most important ethical concerns I learned about in this course regards hidden bias in AI. Any AI system can have biases injected into it and can harm our society without us aware being aware of it. As a developer of machine learning, I need to be aware of my own biases and attempt to design systems that are not inherently biased. I think being self aware is the first step in becoming a better developer.
